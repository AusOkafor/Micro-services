# Dev-only convenience:
# If you're using a Shopify "Develop app" (custom app) token for local development, set this to the
# Admin API access token (often starts with "shpat_"). The backend will use it for Draft Order creation
# to avoid Protected Customer Data restrictions that apply to public apps.
#
# Never set this in production.
